## Stripe Integration

This project uses **Stripe** for payment processing. Make sure to:

1. **Create a Stripe account** at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
2. **Get your API keys** from the Stripe Dashboard.
3. Add the keys to the `.env` file:
   ```env
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
   ```

Without these keys, the payment functionality will not work.
